# 11ty Sass Skeleton

Featuring absolutely nothing beyond a base HTML5 template and the essential setup to watch and compile your Sass alongside 11ty.

Includes minifiying and autoprefixing of styles `postbuild`.

<small>Created by [@5t3ph](https://twitter.com/5t3ph)</small>

## Development Scripts

**`npm start`**

> Run 11ty with hot reload at localhost:8080, including reload based on Sass changes

**`npm run build`**

> Production build includes minified, autoprefixed CSS

Use this as the "Publish command" if needed by hosting such as Netlify.
